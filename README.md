<h2>TEST  HUBTEC  - Tutorial step by step to run this api</h2>
<h5>Click <a href="https://hubtec-front.herokuapp.com/auth/sign-up">Here</a>, to see the project running on heroku.</h5>
<h4>Description</h4>
this is software that allows people to manage their day to day tasks.
React and Ruby on Rails API, because I really like rails, I fell in love with the ruby language, I chose to use react and not Rails MVC, because I'm learning React, I accepted the challenge of doing it in React, I really enjoyed the challenge and thank you Hubtec for the opportunity.

Regarding the decisions, I followed a basic idea of simply each user being able to register their tasks, and tell the status of it, the plan itself, I followed the cards I created in the GitHub project, link during the course of the README, in the commits section .
